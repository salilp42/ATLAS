# ATLAS: Advanced Medical Diffusion Model

## Overview
ATLAS is a medical image diffusion model that incorporates multiple contributions for improved medical image generation. The model focuses on clinical feature preservation, causal relationships, and privacy-preserving mechanisms.

### Key Features
- Clinical Feature Preservation Gates (CFPGs)
- Causal Routing Mechanism with user-defined or learned causal graphs
- Enhanced Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms
- Anatomical Consistency Checking
- Multi-Modal Support (Images, Clinical Text, EHR Data)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/salilp42/ATLAS.git
cd ATLAS
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from atlas.models import AtlasDiffusionModel
from atlas.config import Config

# Initialize configuration
config = Config()

# Create model
model = AtlasDiffusionModel(config)

# Train model
from atlas.utils.training import train
train(config)
```

## Model Architecture
The model implements a U-Net architecture with several novel components:
- Cross-Attention mechanisms for multi-modal fusion
- Clinical Feature Preservation Gates
- Causal Routing modules
- Anatomical Prior Network
